# Fuzzy matching for trivia answers
# Uses Levenshtein distance to allow minor typos/variations in player answers.
# Levenshtein distance counts the minimum single-character edits (insertions,
# deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.
# For example: "Paris" vs "Pars" = distance 1, "Paris" vs "Prais" = distance 2
fuzzy-matching:
  # Enable fuzzy matching (default: true)
  enabled: true

  # Minimum answer length required for fuzzy matching to be used.
  # Answers shorter than this will only use case-insensitive exact matching.
  # This prevents false positives on short answers (e.g., "CPU" vs "GPU" = distance 1).
  # Default: 4
  min-length: 4

  # Matching mode determines how the maximum allowed distance is calculated.
  # Options:
  #   "fixed"    - Uses base-distance as an absolute limit for all answers.
  #                Good for consistent strictness regardless of answer length.
  #   "per-word" - Calculates limit as: base-distance + (word-count * per-word-distance)
  #                More forgiving for longer, multi-word answers.
  # Default: per-word
  mode: per-word

  # Base distance - the starting number of allowed character differences.
  # With mode "fixed", this is the total allowed distance.
  # With mode "per-word", this is added to the per-word calculation.
  # Default: 1
  base-distance: 1

  # Per-word distance - additional allowed differences for each word in the answer.
  # Only used when mode is "per-word".
  # Example with base-distance: 1 and per-word-distance: 1:
  #   "Paris" (1 word) = 1 + (1 * 1) = 2 allowed edits
  #   "Leonardo da Vinci" (3 words) = 1 + (3 * 1) = 4 allowed edits
  # Default: 1
  per-word-distance: 1
